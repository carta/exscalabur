# Code of Conduct

Exscalabur, and Carta as a whole strives to create an open, welcoming environment for all members of our community. To promote this, we pledge to make the participation experience in the Exscalabur project one that is harassment free for all participants regardless of age, race, nationality, gender identity, sexual identity and orientation, religion, socio-economic status, physical appearance, disabilities, and level of experience.

We will work to create a positive environment that is welcoming and inclusive to others, and is empathetic and respectful towards other people's experiences. We will also accept any constructive criticism and will always focus on what is best for the community.

Community members engaging in actions involving:

- Making use of sexualized language, imagery, or otherwise sexually harassing another member of the community
- Trolling, insulting, or attacking another member
- Any form of harassment
- Any form of doxxing

or any other behaviour that would be considered unacceptable or inappropriate in a professional setting will be behaving in an unacceptable manner.

Any project maintainer for the Exscalabur is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any cases of unacceptable behaviour. It's also the right of these maintainers to reject any contributions made to Exscalabur that are not alligned with the code of conduct. It is also the right of a maintainer to ban -- either temporarily or permanently -- any contributor whose behaviour they deem inappropriate or harmful.

Any instances of unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting Exscalabur's current project steward: Jesse Baer-Hennig at jesse.baer-hennig@carta.com. These reports will be reviewed, investigated, and responded to in a manner deemed necessary and appropriate to the situation. As project maintainers, it is our responsibility to remain confidential with regards to the identity of a reporter.

If a project maintainer does not enforce Exscalabur's Code of Conduct in good faith, then they may face repercussions decided by other members of the project's leadership.
