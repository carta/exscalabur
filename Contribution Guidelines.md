# Contributor Guidelines

## Developer Guidelines
Developers and other community members must interact with each other in a manner described by Exscalabur's Code of Conduct.

## Development Process
Exscalabur's development is done through a benevolent dictatorship system. This means that all commits made to Exscalabur will be made with the best interest of the community in mind, and that only members of Carta's leadership are authorized to approve/reject patches submitted. Community members may voice their opinions, but the right to a final say is reserved to members of Exscalabur's leadership.

These leaders are the following:
- Jesse Baer-Hennig
- David Dufour
- Jackson Lo

### Reporting Bugs
Before reporting a bug, ensure that it is a *new* bug. Use GitHub's issue tracker to see if another community member has already reported this bug. Once done, submit an issue on GitHub.

The most important thing to do when reporting a bug is to give a clear description of it. Describe the steps required to reproduce the bug as simply as possible. The simpler it is, the more likely another developer will be able to reproduce and fix it. Give a literal transcript of exactly what you did to cause the bug to appear.

In addition, please give us the following pieces of information:
- operating system
- java version
- scala version
- sbt version
- version/commit of Exscalabur the bug appeared on

Please give a clear description of the bug, specifying how Exscalabur behaved, and how that differs from how you expect Exscalabur to behave.

## Submitting a Patch

1. Fork the Exscalabur repository
2. Create a local branch of the forked repo
3. Commit code __and tests__ to this branch
4. Push the code, and raise a PR from your branch to Exscalabur's master branch

Strive for making the PR as clear and easy to understand as possible, making comments if required. Include a description of what was causing the bug, and what changes were made to fix them.

If a PR is accepted, a member of Exscalabur's administrators will squash and merge the PR.
