Whenever a non-Carta contributor wants to submit a patch to a Carta open source project, they must first sign a
 Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This allows the contributor to retain their ownership in the code
  submitted while granting Carta the necessary legal rights to use that contribution.
  The CLA only needs to be signed once and it covers all Carta projects.
